# nodeJS skeleton

This repository provides infrastructure to start a new nodeJS project and get off the ground running. It includes:
  * [babel](https://babeljs.io/): for the latest ES7+ features 
  * [eslint](https://eslint.org/): with arbitrarily chosen but reasonable starting rule set of [airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/)
  * [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [chai](http://chaijs.com/): for writing and running tests
  * [docker](https://www.docker.com/): with [node:9-alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/) image to run the project platform independently "anywhere"
